## 🚀 About Me

I am a **Data Science Engineer and PhD candidate at LaBRI (Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique), University of Bordeaux**, working at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, and Program Analysis**.

My research focuses on **enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks** by integrating **structured code analysis** into their reasoning and generation processes. I aim to make AI-based developer tools **more reliable, interpretable, and effective** in real-world software engineering scenarios.

I have hands-on experience in:

* **LLM research for code understanding, generation, and debugging**
* **Static code analysis (CodeQL, SonarQube)**
* **Prompt engineering & reinforcement learning**
* **Scalable data engineering and real-time systems**

I enjoy transforming complex research challenges into **practical, high-impact AI solutions**, and collaborating in **multidisciplinary, international research environments**.
